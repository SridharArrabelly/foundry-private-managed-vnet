## Resources Deployed

| Resource | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| VNet | `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks` | Hosts all subnets for private connectivity |
| PE Subnet | Subnet (10.0.1.0/24) | Private endpoints for AI services |
| VM Subnet | Subnet (10.0.2.0/24) | Jumpbox VM |
| Bastion Subnet | AzureBastionSubnet (10.0.3.0/26) | Azure Bastion host |
| AI Foundry | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` (kind: AIServices) | AI Services with project management |
| Foundry Project | `accounts/projects` | Foundry project for model management |
| Foundry **Managed VNet** | `accounts/managednetworks/default` (`AllowOnlyApprovedOutbound`) | Microsoft-managed VNet for the Agent runtime — gives agents/evaluations a private network path to your private resources without you owning the VNet |
| Foundry project connection → Search | `accounts/projects/connections` (CognitiveSearch, `authType: ProjectManagedIdentity`) | Tells the agent runtime how to reach AI Search; auto-creates an approved managed private endpoint from the managed VNet to the Search service. **MUST be `ProjectManagedIdentity` — `AAD` is passthrough auth and fails in the agent runtime context.** |
| RBAC: Foundry account MI → Resource Group | Azure AI Enterprise Network Connection Approver | Lets the account auto-approve the managed PE created in its managed VNet |
| text-embedding-3-large | Model deployment (GlobalStandard) | Embedding model for vectorizing documents (3072 dims) |
| gpt-4.1-mini | Model deployment (GlobalStandard) | Chat/completion model |
| AI Search | `Microsoft.Search/searchServices` (basic) | Search index for document chunks |
| RBAC: Foundry account MI → Search | Search Index Data Contributor + Search Service Contributor | Lets the Foundry account read/write the search index |
| RBAC: Foundry **project** MI → Search | Search Index Data Contributor + Search Service Contributor | Lets agents (which run as the project MI) use the AI Search tool |
| RBAC: Jumpbox MI → Search | Search Index Data Contributor + Search Service Contributor | Lets the indexer (running on the jumpbox) create the index and upload chunks |
| RBAC: Jumpbox MI → Foundry | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | Lets the indexer call the embedding model |
| Private Endpoint (Foundry) | `Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints` | Private connectivity to AI Foundry |
| Private Endpoint (Search) | `Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints` | Private connectivity to AI Search |
| Private DNS Zone (Foundry — account) | `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com` | DNS for Foundry account control/data plane |
| Private DNS Zone (Foundry — OpenAI) | `privatelink.openai.azure.com` | DNS for the OpenAI/inference data plane (required by Foundry Agents) |
| Private DNS Zone (Foundry — AI Services) | `privatelink.services.ai.azure.com` | DNS for the AI Services data plane (required by Foundry Agents portal) |
| Private DNS Zone (Search) | `privatelink.search.windows.net` | DNS resolution for Search PE |
| Windows 11 VM | `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` (Standard_B2ms, System MI) | Jumpbox for testing private access and running the indexer |
| Azure Bastion | `Microsoft.Network/bastionHosts` (Standard, tunneling enabled) | Secure RDP / native client tunneling to VM without public IP |
| NAT Gateway | `Microsoft.Network/natGateways` (Standard) attached to VM subnet | Dedicated outbound internet for the jumpbox (Azure is retiring default outbound access) |

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) installed — already present in Azure Cloud Shell
- Azure CLI (`az`) installed and authenticated — used by `azd` for some operations and by the postprovision hook to invoke the indexer on the jumpbox
- Subscription with **Owner** role (or Contributor + RBAC Administrator) — required because the deployment creates role assignments
- A clone of this repository (the postprovision hook reads the git remote to know where the jumpbox should download the code from)

You do **not** need Python installed locally — Python is installed on the jumpbox VM by the postprovision script and used there.

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
# First time only: log in and create an environment
azd auth login
azd env new <your-env-name>     # pick any name, e.g. foundry-net-dev

# (Optional) set non-default values BEFORE running azd up
azd env set ALLOWED_IP_ADDRESS  <your.public.ip>   # only if you want portal access from your IP
azd env set VM_ADMIN_USERNAME   azureadmin
azd env set PREFIX              <lowercase-prefix>   # defaults to env name

# Deploy
azd up
```

`azd up` will prompt for the Azure subscription, location, and the required `vmAdminPassword` (stored securely, not written to disk). All other values come from the azd environment.

After provisioning succeeds, the `postprovision` hook runs `scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py` **on the jumpbox VM** via `az vm run-command`. The hook itself runs wherever you invoked `azd up` (your machine or Cloud Shell); it bootstraps Python on the VM, downloads this repo from GitHub, and runs the indexer using the VM's system-assigned managed identity (which has been granted Search + Foundry RBAC by the deployment).

This works the same from Cloud Shell as from a local machine — `ALLOWED_IP_ADDRESS` does **not** need to be set, because all indexer traffic to the private endpoints originates from the jumpbox (which is on the VNet).

Assumption: this GitHub repo is public (so the jumpbox can download it via HTTPS without auth). If you fork to a private repo, replace the download step in `scripts/jumpbox-bootstrap.ps1` accordingly.

Expected first-run timings:
- `azd provision`: ~10–15 minutes (Bastion + VM dominate)
- `postprovision` hook on the jumpbox: ~5–10 minutes (Python install + pip + indexing)

Environment variables consumed by `infra/main.parameters.json`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AZURE_ENV_NAME` | yes (set by `azd env new`) | Used to name the resource group (`rg-<env>`) and tag resources |
| `AZURE_LOCATION` | yes (prompted by `azd up`) | Azure region (e.g. `australiaeast`, `eastus`) |
| `PREFIX` | no | Resource name prefix (lowercase, no special chars). Defaults to `AZURE_ENV_NAME` |
| `ALLOWED_IP_ADDRESS` | no | Your public IP for portal access. Empty = fully private |
| `VM_ADMIN_USERNAME` | no | Jumpbox admin user (default: `azureadmin`) |
| `VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes (prompted) | Jumpbox admin password (12+ chars, upper/lower/number/special) |

### 2. Connect to Jumpbox via Bastion (optional — for manual exploration)

The indexer has already run automatically. Connect to the jumpbox if you want to use the Foundry/Search portals interactively, inspect the index, or re-run the indexer manually.

1. Azure Portal → your resource group → `bas-<prefix>` (Bastion)
2. Click **Connect** → select `vm-<prefix>`
3. Enter the admin credentials you set during `azd up`
4. From the VM, open a browser — you now have private access to:
   - Foundry portal: `https://ai.azure.com`
   - AI Search portal: `https://srch-<prefix>.search.windows.net`

Or via CLI (Bastion native client tunneling is enabled):
```bash
az network bastion rdp \
  --name bas-<prefix> \
  --resource-group rg-<env> \
  --target-resource-id $(az vm show -g rg-<env> -n vm-<prefix> --query id -o tsv)
```

### 3. Re-run the indexer manually (optional)

The `postprovision` hook runs automatically on `azd up`. To re-run it later — for example after dropping new files into `data/` and pushing them to the repo — call the hook script directly:

```bash
# from Cloud Shell or your local machine, in the repo root, after azd env is loaded
./scripts/postprovision.sh        # Linux / macOS / Cloud Shell
./scripts/postprovision.ps1       # Windows PowerShell
```

Or skip the wrapper and invoke it via azd:
```bash
azd hooks run postprovision
```

To run the indexer interactively *on the jumpbox* (e.g. for debugging), connect via Bastion and from a PowerShell prompt:
```powershell
# the bootstrap script is the same one the hook invokes
pwsh C:\Path\To\jumpbox-bootstrap.ps1 `
  -RepoUrl https://github.com/SridharArrabelly/foundry-network-test.git `
  -RepoBranch master `
  -AiSearchEndpoint  https://srch-<prefix>.search.windows.net `
  -AiFoundryEndpoint https://ais-<prefix>.cognitiveservices.azure.com
```

## Network Flow

1. **Foundry → AI Search**: Uses Foundry's system-assigned MI over the private endpoint. Traffic stays on the Azure backbone.
2. **Jumpbox → AI Search / Foundry (indexer)**: VM resolves the privatelink DNS zones to PE IPs, authenticates with the VM's system-assigned MI, and calls both services over the private endpoints.
3. **You → Foundry/Search portals**: Connect to the jumpbox via Bastion; the VM resolves private DNS to PE IPs.
4. **Cloud Shell / your laptop → Jumpbox indexer**: The `postprovision` hook reaches the jumpbox via the Azure ARM control plane (`az vm run-command`), which does not require network connectivity to the private endpoints from your machine.
5. **Foundry Agent runtime → AI Search (the "AI Search tool")**: This is the trickiest path — see below.

## Foundry Agent runtime networking (Managed VNet)

> **Why this matters:** When you click *Run* on an agent that uses the **AI Search tool**, the call to AI Search does **not** come from your VNet, your jumpbox, or the Foundry account's PE. It comes from the **Foundry Agent runtime**, which runs on Microsoft-managed compute *outside* your VNet. With AI Search set to `publicNetworkAccess: disabled`, that runtime has no path to your Search service — agent runs fail with **"Invalid endpoint or connection failed."** RBAC alone does not fix this.

This template solves it using **Foundry Managed Virtual Network** (GA, May 2026):

```
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Microsoft-managed VNet (per Foundry acct)  │
   │  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐    │
   │  │  Agent runtime + Evaluations       │    │
   │  └────────────┬───────────────────────┘    │
   │               │ (approved outbound)        │
   │               ▼                            │
   │  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐    │
   │  │  Managed Private Endpoint → Search │────┼──► Your private srch-… (PE-only)
   │  └────────────────────────────────────┘    │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

How it's configured in this template (`infra/modules/ai-foundry.bicep`):

1. **Account property** `networkInjections: [{ scenario: 'agent', useMicrosoftManagedNetwork: true }]` tells Foundry to host its agent runtime in a Microsoft-managed VNet.
2. **Sub-resource** `accounts/managednetworks/default` with `IsolationMode: AllowOnlyApprovedOutbound` provisions that VNet and locks outbound to approved targets only.
3. **Project connection** (`accounts/projects/connections`, category `CognitiveSearch`, **`authType: ProjectManagedIdentity`**) targets the AI Search resource. Foundry sees that the target service supports private link and **auto-creates a managed private endpoint** from the managed VNet to the Search service. *⚠️ `authType: AAD` is user-passthrough and fails in the agent runtime — must be `ProjectManagedIdentity`.*
4. **Role assignment** — the Foundry account's MI gets `Azure AI Enterprise Network Connection Approver` on the resource group so it can auto-approve that managed PE.
5. **Project MI RBAC** — the project's system-assigned MI gets `Search Index Data Contributor` + `Search Service Contributor` on the Search service (agent calls authenticate as the project MI, *not* the account MI).

### Three requirements, all must be met

| Requirement | Without it | With it |
|---|---|---|
| **Connection auth** (`authType: ProjectManagedIdentity`) | "Invalid endpoint or connection failed" — runtime tries user passthrough, no token in context | Agent runtime authenticates as the project MI |
| **RBAC** (project MI → Search data plane) | 403 Forbidden | Allowed |
| **Network reachability** (managed VNet → private Search) | Connection refused / "Invalid endpoint" | Reachable via managed PE |

After `azd up` / `azd provision`, allow ~2–5 min for managed network provisioning, PE auto-approval, and RBAC propagation before re-running the agent.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `IfMatchPreconditionFailed` during provision | Two resources updated the same parent in parallel. The template already serializes the known cases (two PEs on one subnet, role assignments on one scope). If a new one appears, add an explicit `dependsOn`. |
| `InsufficientQuota` on embedding deployment | Lower `capacity` in `infra/modules/ai-foundry.bicep` or request quota in your region. |
| `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` 403 from the indexer | RBAC propagation can take 5–10 minutes; re-run `azd hooks run postprovision`. |
| `Private network access required` in Foundry portal | Access from jumpbox VM via Bastion, or set `azd env set ALLOWED_IP_ADDRESS <your.ip>` and re-provision. |
| DNS not resolving to private IP | Verify private DNS zones are linked to VNet: Portal → DNS Zone → Virtual network links. |
| Bastion can't connect | `AzureBastionSubnet` must be /26; Bastion takes ~5 min to provision. If the VM was auto-deallocated, `az vm start -g <rg> -n <vm>` first. |
| Jumpbox has no internet access (pip / GitHub fails) | Azure is retiring "default outbound access" for VMs. The template attaches a NAT Gateway to the VM subnet to provide deterministic egress — `azd provision` to apply if you're on an older environment. |
| Postprovision hook fails: "VM not found" | Check `azd env get-values` includes `JUMPBOX_VM_NAME` and `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`. Re-run `azd provision` if missing. |
| `az vm run-command` times out | The bootstrap takes up to 10 min on first run (Python install). Retry with `azd hooks run postprovision`. |
| Hook prints "Indexer failed on jumpbox" with stderr | The bootstrap surfaces the VM-side error. Common causes: parser errors if you edit `jumpbox-bootstrap.ps1` with PowerShell 7+ syntax (the VM runs Windows PowerShell **5.1** — avoid `?.`, `??`, ternary, etc.); or transient RBAC propagation (re-run the hook after a few minutes). |
| Python installer returns exit code `1603` | Python is already installed on the jumpbox from a prior run. The bootstrap checks `C:\Python312\python.exe` first to skip re-install — pull latest and re-run the hook. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'` on the jumpbox | Python's `sys.prefix` was derived from cwd instead of the install dir. The bootstrap sets `PYTHONHOME` to pin it. Pull latest. |
| `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode` on the jumpbox | Windows console defaults to cp1252. The bootstrap sets `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` and `PYTHONUTF8=1`. Pull latest. |
| Foundry portal (Agents page) on the jumpbox shows **"Public access is disabled. Please configure private endpoint."** | The Foundry Agents experience calls `*.openai.azure.com` and `*.services.ai.azure.com` in addition to `*.cognitiveservices.azure.com`. All three `privatelink.*` zones must be linked to the VNet and attached to the Foundry PE's DNS zone group (the template does this). If you see this on an environment provisioned before this fix, run `azd provision` to add the missing zones. |
| Agent run with AI Search tool fails: **"Invalid endpoint or connection failed."** | Three requirements must all be met. **(1) Connection auth:** the project's Search connection MUST have `authType: ProjectManagedIdentity`. The default `AAD` is *user-passthrough* and has no token in the agent runtime context — the bicep sets this correctly; if you see "Microsoft Entra ID" (without "Project Managed Identity") in the portal, edit the connection's authentication. **(2) RBAC:** the project's MI needs `Search Index Data Contributor` + `Search Service Contributor` on the search service. **(3) Network reachability:** Managed VNet (`useMicrosoftManagedNetwork: true`) + auto-created managed private endpoint to Search. After `azd provision`, allow ~2–5 min for RBAC + managed PE provisioning before re-running the agent. |

## Cleanup

```bash
azd down --purge --force
```

`--purge` permanently removes soft-deleted Cognitive Services / Key Vault resources so the prefix can be reused. Omit `--force` if you want to be prompted for confirmation.
